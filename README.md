# MNIST-CNN

This is my implementation of the CNN. The project was done mainly for educational purposes and to make sure I have a good grasp on the basics of neural networks. The maximum accuracy on the training dataset -- 84.32%. 

# ToDo

The main goal is adding more convolutional and pooling layers, as well as trying out different loss functions. Hyperparameter optimization is also credible.
